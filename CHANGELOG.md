## Unreleased

### Changed

- Improved YARD documentation, which is now available here https://rubydoc.info/gems/phlex
- `SGML#render` can now render lambdas with zero or one arguments. Previously, it could only render lambdas with exactly one argument, although it could always render Procs with any number of arguments. When an argument is accepted, the `self` of the component rendering it is yielded to the Proc.
