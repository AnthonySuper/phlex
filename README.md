## Maintenance schedule

### Bug fixes

- Only the latest minor version of each major version will receive bug fixes
- We may choose to fix bugs by releasing a new minor version rather than patching the existing minor version
- Major versions will stop receiving bug fixes one year after the next major version is released

### Security patches

- When a security issue is brought to our attention, we aim to release patches for any minor version that was released in the last year.
- Additionally, the latest minor version of the latest major version will receive security patches, even if that version is over a year old.
